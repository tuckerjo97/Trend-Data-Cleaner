# Trend-Data-Cleaner
R scripts to clean survey data and identify shopping corridors in the city of Chicago. Utilized Google API to map locations of stores visited and consumer patterns. Manipulated over 8,000 survey responses to design a usable format of reliable consumer information along with developing a generalized script that could be run again in future iterations of the survey with no outside management.

Demographics script used to pull statistics about shoppers, including ethnicity, age, location, ect.
